# 📘 Understanding Generative AI: A Complete Guide

## 1. What is AI?  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate **learning, comprehension, problem-solving, decision-making, creativity, and autonomy**.  

---

## 2. What is Generative AI?  
Generative AI (Gen AI) is artificial intelligence that can **create original content** such as text, images, video, audio, or software code in response to a user’s prompt.  

It relies on **deep learning models** that simulate the learning and decision-making processes of the human brain by identifying and encoding patterns in massive datasets.

## 3. How Does Generative AI Work?  

Generative AI operates in three key phases:  

### 🔧 Training  
- Build a **foundation model** trained on massive unstructured data (text, images, audio).  
- Learns through millions of prediction tasks (e.g., predicting the next word).  
- Requires huge computational resources (thousands of GPUs, weeks of training).  

### 🔧 Tuning  
- Foundation models are **generalists**; fine-tuning makes them specialists.  
- Fine-tuning uses labeled data.  
- **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback)** improves model quality.  

### 🔁 Generation, Evaluation & Retuning  
- Focuses on quality, diversity, and speed of outputs.  
- Continuous evaluation ensures accuracy, relevance, and efficiency.
